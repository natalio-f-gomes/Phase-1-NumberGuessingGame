# Phase-1-NumberGuessingGame
### This readme file was auto generated by AI

A simple console-based Java game that offers two modes of play:

1. **Human guesses the number** – The computer picks a random number between 0 and 100, and the player tries to guess it with feedback ("Higher" or "Lower").
2. **Computer guesses the number** – The player thinks of a number between 0 and 100, and the computer attempts to guess it using a simple random search within shrinking bounds, receiving feedback from the player.

## Features

- Interactive menu to choose game mode or quit.
- Human mode: Unlimited guesses with hint feedback and final guess count.
- Computer mode: Computer makes random guesses within the current range and narrows the range based on player input (H/L/C).
- Basic input validation and error handling.

**Note:** This is a beginner-level educational project with some known bugs (see below).
